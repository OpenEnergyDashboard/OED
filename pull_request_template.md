Fixes #[issue]

(In general, OED likes to have at least one issue associated with each pull request. Replace [issue] with the OED GitHub issue number. In the preview you will see an issue description if you hover over that number. You can create one yourself before doing this pull request. This is where details are normally given on what is being addressed. Note you should not use the word "Fixes" if it does not completely address the issue since the issue would automatically be closed on merging the pull request. In that case use "Partly Addresses #[issue].)
