Open Energy Dashboard is a user-friendly way to display energy information from smart energy meters, designed and built by faculty and students at Beloit College. It is designed for institutions of higher education, and is optimized for non-technical users with a simple interface that provides access to your institution's energy data through the powerful Chart.js data graphing system.
