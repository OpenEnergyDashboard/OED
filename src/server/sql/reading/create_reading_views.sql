	The following views are all generated in src/server/models/Reading.js in createReadingsMaterializedViews.

*/

/*
The query shared by all of these views gets slow when one of two things happen:
	1) It has to scan a large percentage of the readings table
	2) It has to generate a large number of rows (by compressing to a small interval)
We pick the best of both worlds by only materializing the large duration tables (day+ and then hour+).
These produce fewer rows, making them acceptable to store,
but they benefit from materialization because they require a scan of a large percentage of
the readings table (to aggregate data over a large time range). The hourly table may not be that much smaller than
the meter data but it can make it much faster for meters that read at sub-hour intervals so it's worth the
extra disk space.

The daily and hourly views are used when they give a minimum number of points as specified by the supplied
parameter. It first tries daily since this is fastest, then hourly and finally uses raw/meter data if necessary.
The goal is that the number of readings touched is never that large and when doing raw/meter readings the
time range should be small so the number of readings retrieved is not large. It is assumed that the indices/optimizations
allow for getting a subset of the raw/meter readings quickly.
 */

/**
The next two create a view/table that takes the raw/meter readings and averages them for each day or hour.
This is used by the line graph function below to make them faster since the values
are already averaged. There are two types of readings: quantity and flow/raw. The quantity
readings must be normalized by their time length. The flow/raw readings are already by time
so they are just averaged. The one table contains both types of readings but are now equivalent
so the line reading functions can use them both in the same way.
