 * Handle all data, assume that the first row is the first reading if increasing and last is first reading if decreasing.

 * 	row 2: reading #2
 * => reading #1 = row 1
 *    reading #2 = row 2
 *    If cumulative then reading #0 is either calculated value from the last reading from last previous upload or will be dropped.
 * @param {object[[]]} rows array of readings where each index is in the format [reading, startTime, endTime] where date/time is
 *   either a string or a Moment. Note the start/endTime
 *   are actually date/time where you cannot have the day of month first in date. This is what moment can deal with.
 *   No start time if isEndOnly true.
 * @param {number} meterID meter id being input
 * @param {string} timeSort the canonical order sorted by date/time in which the data appears in the data file 
 *   'increasing' or 'decreasing'), default 'increasing'
 * @param {number} readingRepetition value is 1 if reading is not duplicated. 2 if repeated twice and so on (such as E-mon D-mon meters)
 * @param {boolean} isCumulative true if the data is cumulative and false otherwise
 * @param {boolean} cumulativeReset true if the cumulative data can reset and false otherwise
 * @param {string} resetStart a string representation in the format "HH:mm:ss.SSS" which represents the start time a cumulativeReset may occur after.
 *    The :ss.SSS can be left off. The default resetStart time is '00:00:00.000'
 * @param {string} resetEnd a string which represents the end time a cumulativeReset may occur before in same format as resetStart.
 *  The default resetEnd time is '23:59:99.999'
 * @param {number} readingGap the allowed time variation in seconds that a gap may occur between two readings, default 0
 * @param {number} readingLengthVariation the allowed time variation in seconds that two readings may deviate in time
 *   length from each other, default 0
 * @param {boolean} isEndTime true if the data only has an endTimestamp, default false. If true then each index in row only has start timestamp.
 * @param {dict} conditionSet used to validate readings (minVal, maxVal, minDate, maxDate, interval, maxError)
 * @param {array} conn the connection to the database
 * @param {boolean} honorDst true if this meter's times shift when crossing DST, false otherwise (default false)
 * @param {boolean} relaxedParsing true if the parsing of readings allows for non-standard formats, default if false since this can give bad dates/times.
 * @returns {object[]} {array of readings accepted, true if all readings accepted and false otherwise, all messages from processing}
