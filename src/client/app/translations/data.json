Bar shows the total usage (e.g., kWh) for the time frame of each bar where you can control the time frame. Compare allows you to see the current usage vs. the usage in the last previous period for a day, week and four weeks. Map graphs show a spacial image of each meter where the circle size is related to four weeks of usage. Clicking on one of the choices (Line, Bar, Compare, Map) renders that graphic.
