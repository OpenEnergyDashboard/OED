# Though generally not needed, it is possible that you need to refresh the reading views after a migration.
# This is definitely needed for the migration to 1.0.0 because it deletes the old views and creates new ones.
# It is quite possible this could be commented out in the future but it probably does not do any harm except
# taking a little time.
